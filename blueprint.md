# Website Blueprint: The One-Page Experience

The website is a single, scrolling page composed of several distinct sections.

### Section 1: The Hero & Manifesto
- **Layout:** A powerful, typography-focused hero section.
- **Content Theme:** Write a concise, hard-hitting manifesto based on the ethos in `framework.md`. It should challenge the status quo of bloated software and introduce BareStack's philosophy of subtraction and simplicity. End with a strong, memorable tagline like "BareStack. Barebones. Bare Necessities."

### Section 2: The First Product
- **Layout:** A two-column layout. One column for text, the other for a visual.
- **Content Theme:** Introduce the first product, "BareCRM." Describe its core benefit as a ridiculously simple and focused tool, contrasting it with complex enterprise CRMs.
- **Visuals:** In the visual column, place a clean, minimalist placeholder for an image or animation of the BareCRM software.

### Section 3: Core Principles / Features
- **Layout:** A three or four-column card-based layout.
- **Content Theme:** Create a series of cards, each representing one of the "Guiding Principles" from `framework.md` (e.g., "Subtract, Don't Add"). Write a short, benefit-oriented description for each principle.
- **Visuals:** Each card could have a very simple, abstract icon that visually represents the principle.

### Section 4: The Waitlist
- **Layout:** A simple, centered, and prominent call-to-action section.
- **Content Theme:** Write a compelling invitation for users to join the community. Emphasize that they will be the first to know about new, simple, and free tools.
- **Action:** A simple email input form.
