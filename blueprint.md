# BareStack Project Blueprint

## Project Mission
To create a CRM that is simple, easy, and non-complicated. A barebones, highly effective tool that eliminates the bloat and overwhelming complexity of mainstream CRMs. No bullshit, just results.

## Core Problem
Existing CRMs are powerful but notoriously complex, expensive, and bloated. They force small teams to focus on learning the software instead of selling.

## Target Audience
- **Primary:** Small business owners, agencies, and small teams (2-10 people) who need to focus on core sales activities, not software administration.

## Guiding Principles
1. **Radical Simplicity:** If a feature adds complexity, it is rejected by default.
2. **Effectiveness over Features:** Success is measured by user outcomes (deals closed), not the feature count.
3. **Aesthetic Minimalism:** The design must be clean, calm, and beautiful. It should feel like a breath of fresh air.
4. **Speed is a Feature:** The application must be incredibly fast and responsive.

## Core 'Barebones' Feature Set
- **Contact Management:** Add, edit, and view contacts.
- **Interaction Logging:** Add notes and log meetings for each contact.
- **Deal Funnel:** Track contacts through customizable stages (e.g., Lead, Meeting Scheduled, Closed).
- **Tagging:** Simple, flexible tagging for organization.

## Anti-Goals (What We Will Never Be)
- We are not an all-in-one marketing automation platform.
- We will not have complex, multi-layered reporting dashboards.
- We will not require a dedicated administrator to manage.
- We will not be "expensive as fuck." The core product will be free for as long as possible.
