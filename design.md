# BareStack Design System

## Design Methodology
The design is calm, stable, and authentic, presented in a modern, dynamic layout. The goal is a focused, uncluttered experience that feels premium and engaging.

## Color Palette: "Grounded & Calm"
- **Background:** Parchment (`#F7F5F2`)
- **Text:** Rich Loam (`#413C3A`)
- **Primary Accent (Buttons/Links):** Terracotta (`#E07A5F`)
- **Secondary Accent (Borders/Highlights):** Sage Green (`#84A98C`)

## Typography: "Clean & Readable"
- **Headings:** Inter
- **Body Text:** Source Sans Pro

## Layout & Whitespace
- Use a component-based, alternating grid layout inspired by modern SaaS sites.
- Maintain generous whitespace around all elements and sections. The layout must breathe.

## Animations & Interactivity
- **Scroll Animations:** Implement subtle "fade-in and slide-up" reveal animations on elements as the user scrolls into view. Animations should be smooth and gentle, not jarring.
- **Hover Effects:** Interactive elements like buttons and cards should have smooth, subtle transitions on hover (e.g., a slight lift or color change).
