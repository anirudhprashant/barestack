# BareStack Technical Framework

## Core Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Self-hosted via Coolify)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment:** Self-hosted on Hetzner via Coolify

## Architectural Approach
Subtractive. We will start with a feature-rich, open-source CRM and aggressively remove features, code, and UI elements that do not align with our "barebones but highly effective" philosophy.

## Confirmed Decisions
- **Authentication:** Google Sign-In and standard Email/Password login are both required.
- **Database Hosting:** The Postgres database will be self-hosted on the main Hetzner server, managed by Coolify.

## Key Decisions to be Made
- **Open-Source Base:** Evaluate and select the best open-source CRM to use as a foundation. (Research task in progress).
