# BareStack Framework: The "Why"

## The Ethos: Quietly Powerful Software
- **Radical Simplicity:** We build tools that are ruthlessly simple, focusing only on essential features.
- **Honest and Transparent:** No corporate jargon, no marketing fluff, no hidden costs.
- **Focus on the Craft, Not the Tool:** Our products are designed to fade into the background.
- **Accessible by Default:** We are committed to making our products free or open-source.

## Guiding Principles
1. **Subtract, Don't Add:** Always ask "What can we remove?" first.
2. **Clarity Over Cleverness:** Use simple language and intuitive design.
3. **Speed is a Feature:** A minimalist product must be blazingly fast.
4. **Opinionated by Design:** Present the best way to do a task, not all possible ways.
